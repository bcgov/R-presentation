In order to contribute to this repository (as a member of the BC Stats team), please clone the repo locally and add/remove/modify content in the `presentation.Rmd` file. 
After saving the changes, "knit" the RMarkdown file, which will produce a new `presentation.html` file. At that point, push all the changes to the remote repo.

The link at the top of the `README.md` file automatically updates everytime there is a new `presentation.html` file pushed to the repository.
